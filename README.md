# CS50AI-Projects

Please find my solutions for the CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python Course in this repo.

# Week 0 : 

- Search

-- Degrees - Based on the game 'Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon', the program wants to find the shortest possible distance between any two actors (if it exists)
We do this by considering the actors as nodes or vertices in a graph and edges as the movies that connect two actors and run a Breadth-First Search Algorithm to find the minimum distance.

-- Tic Tac Toe - Used Minimax algorithm to implement an AI Tic-Tac-Toe game where the computer can never lose.

# Week 1 : 

- Knowledge

-- Knights - an AI that will make inferences based on the knowledge it has acquired throughout.

-- Minesweeper - an AI that uses the pygame feature to enable a typical minesweeper game. The AI helps the user guess the next move. 

# Week 2 :

- Uncertainity

-- PageRank - an AI to rank webpages based on their importance by using probability (Used in Search Engine Optimization)

-- Heredity - an AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait.

# Week 3 :

- Optimization

-- Crossword - an AI that generates crossword puzzles

# Week 4 :

- Learning

-- Shopping - an AI to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase

-- Nim - an AI that teaches itself to play the game 'Nim' through reinforcement learning
